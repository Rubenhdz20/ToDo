# ToDo React

This is a todo list created with react, and the technologies I used were:

- Vite 
- React Hooks (useContext, useState, useEffect)
- Local Storage 
- Custom Hooks
- Tailwind CSS
- Figma for the prototype 

I found this project very challenging and very useful to understand the basics of React and its philosophy.
